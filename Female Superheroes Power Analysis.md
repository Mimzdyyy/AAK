# 🦸‍♀️ Female Superheroes Power Analysis  
by Maria  

---

## 🧩 Overview  
This project explores the landscape of female superheroes by analyzing their powers, physical traits, and abilities. Through data wrangling, categorization, and visual storytelling, I created a philosophical and analytical view of what defines a superheroine.

---

## 🛠️ What I Did (Task Recap)  

- Loaded and cleaned superhero datasets  
- Filtered for female characters only  
- Merged powers and character info  
- Categorized powers into 4 main types  
- Created multiple visualizations with insights  
- Reflected on cultural storytelling around female heroes  

---

## 📊 Visual Insights  

### 1. 🔝 Top 10 Most Common Powers  
- 🥇 Super Strength dominates  
- Agility, Stamina, and Durability are frequent  
- Stealth and Energy Blasts hint at strategy  

🧠 _"Physical traits are central in superhero storytelling—especially for women."_  

---

### 2. 📏 Height vs. Total Powers  
- Most heroes: 150–190 cm  
- No correlation between height & powers  
- Outliers include super tall or ultra-powered heroes  

🧠 _"Small doesn’t mean weak. Tall doesn’t mean stronger. Power breaks the mold."_  

---

### 3. 📈 Total Powers Distribution  
- Most heroes have 4–10 powers  
- Right-skewed: few have 30+ powers  
- Peak: 5–7 powers  

🧠 _"There’s a balance point — where most heroines live between realism and fantasy."_

### 4. 🧬 Power Type Breakdown  
| Power Type | Count | Examples |
|------------|-------|----------------------------|
| 🏋️ Physical | 200+  | Strength, Agility, Stamina |
| 🧠 Mental   | ~30   | Telepathy, Mind Control    |
| 🎯 Ranged   | ~40   | Energy Blasts, Projectiles |
| 🕵️‍♀️ Stealth | ~20   | Invisibility, Camouflage   |

🧠 _"Most female characters are written as physically dominant, with mental or stealthy powers still underexplored."_

## 🔮 Final Reflection  

This isn’t just data. It’s a cultural mirror.  
It shows us that:

- Strength still defines most heroines  
- Mental and stealth abilities are rare, yet powerful  
- There’s space for richer storytelling — beyond brute force  

💬 _"Power isn’t in size. It’s in presence. In story. In surprise."_
